		<p>I was born in the capital of <b>Flopan, Flopkyo, in March 27nd, 2020</b>, sometime shortly after the Empire of Flopan was defeated by the United Flops.<p>
		<p>I spent my early years playing with the other silly little kittens and kitties and found a natural inclination towards activities relating to the water, unlike the rest of my peers, who, as their biology goes, naturally dislike water.</p>
		<p>I earned my nickname "<b>Sea Urchin</b>" after the other kittens noticed me playing in the water one day. Ever since, the name has stuck with me.</p>
		<p>I am great at sports such as water skiing, surfboarding, and scuba diving. This talent allowed me to qualify for the <b>1968</b> olympics taking place in Flopxico as a representative for mine home country, Flopan, where I earned a gold medal in Surfing.</p>
		<h2><strong>I am the strongest!</strong></h2>
		<p>Because of my physically-taxing hobbies, I often looks for comfy places to rest. Luckily for me, I lives right next to a <ins>cardboard box factory</ins>, where I am able to get a fresh supply of cardboard boxes to sit in. ╰ (´꒳`) ╯</p>
